    <h2>Simple but unbeatable.</h2>
    <p>Baked Chicken makes an easy but delicous night</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin or the flat side of a mallet, gently pound them to even thickness, about 0.5 to 0.75 inches.</li>
       <li>Rub the chicken breasts all over with olive oil. Combine all of the seasoning and the brown sugar in a small bowl and sprinkle on both sides of the chicken.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a 9x13 caserole dish.</li>
        <li>Top each chicken breast with a dab of butter, then bake for 18-20 minutes, until the internal temperature reads 165Â°F. I like to turn on the broiler for the last 2-3 minutes to add some nice browning, just watch closely so it doesn't burn!</li>
        
    </ol>
